# How to Download and Install Civil 3D 2016 Portable 32 Bit
 
Civil 3D 2016 is a civil engineering software that supports Building Information Modeling (BIM) and helps reduce the time it takes to design, analyze, and implement changes. However, Civil 3D 2016 does not support 32-bit operating systems, so you cannot install it on a Windows 7 32-bit system. The last version of Civil 3D that supported 32-bit operating systems was Civil 3D 2013[^1^].

If you still want to use Civil 3D 2016 on a 32-bit system, you have two options: either upgrade your system to a 64-bit operating system, or use a portable version of Civil 3D 2016 that does not require installation. A portable version is a compressed file that contains all the necessary files and settings to run the software without installing it on your computer. You can download a portable version of Civil 3D 2016 from various online sources, such as [^2^] or [^4^], but be aware that these sources are not official or authorized by Autodesk, and may contain viruses or malware. Use them at your own risk.
 
To use a portable version of Civil 3D 2016, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the portable version of Civil 3D 2016 from one of the sources mentioned above. The file size may vary depending on the source, but it should be around 2 GB.
2. Extract the compressed file to a folder on your computer or an external drive. You can use any file extraction software, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip.
3. Open the folder where you extracted the file and double-click on the executable file named "Civil3D.exe" or something similar. This will launch the software without installing it on your system.
4. Enjoy using Civil 3D 2016 on your 32-bit system.

Note that some features or functions of Civil 3D 2016 may not work properly on a portable version, and you may encounter errors or crashes. Also, you will not be able to update or patch the software, as it is not registered with Autodesk. If you want to use Civil 3D 2016 with full functionality and support, we recommend upgrading your system to a 64-bit operating system and installing the official version of Civil 3D 2016 from Autodesk's website.
