## Why is *Blue* so special?
 
*Blue* is Joni Mitchell's fourth studio album, and the first one that she produced entirely by herself. It features 10 songs that showcase her stunning voice, poetic lyrics, and innovative guitar tunings. The album is a deeply personal and emotional journey, as Mitchell explores themes of love, loss, identity, and travel. She wrote most of the songs after a turbulent breakup with her longtime partner Graham Nash, and during a period of restless wandering across Europe and North America.
 
The album received critical acclaim upon its release, and has since been ranked among the greatest albums of all time by various publications and critics. Rolling Stone magazine named it the third best album of the 1970s, and the 30th best album of all time. NPR called it "the ultimate breakup album", and Pitchfork praised it as "a flawless work of art". The album has also influenced countless artists across genres, such as Prince, Taylor Swift, Tori Amos, James Blake, and Lana Del Rey.
 
## What are some of the highlights of *Blue*?
 
*Blue* is an album that deserves to be listened to from start to finish, as each song contributes to the overall mood and narrative. However, some of the standout tracks include:
 
- **All I Want**: The opening track sets the tone for the album, as Mitchell sings about her desire for love and adventure over a bright acoustic guitar. She expresses her longing for "a lover who will give me peace of mind", but also admits that she is "on a lonely road and I am traveling".
- **Carey**: One of the most upbeat songs on the album, *Carey* is inspired by Mitchell's friendship with a colorful character she met in Crete. She invites him to join her on her travels, while also teasing him about his "mean old daddy" and his "red red wine". The song features a lively mandolin played by Stephen Stills.
- **River**: Perhaps the most famous song on the album, *River* is a heartbreaking ballad about regret and nostalgia. Mitchell uses the metaphor of a frozen river to express her wish to escape from her mistakes and start over. She also references the classic Christmas song *Jingle Bells*, creating a contrast between the festive season and her sadness.
- **A Case of You**: Another song about a failed relationship, *A Case of You* is a stunning display of Mitchell's vocal range and lyrical prowess. She compares her lover to a drink that she could "drink a case of" and still be on her feet. She also reflects on how she has changed because of him, saying "I could be your painter baby / Paint you anything you see / Or I could be your lover / Teach you everything I know". The song features a dulcimer played by Mitchell herself.
- **The Last Time I Saw Richard**: The closing track of the album is a haunting portrait of disillusionment and cynicism. Mitchell recalls a conversation with an old friend who has given up on his dreams and settled for a mundane life. She contrasts his bleak outlook with her own hopefulness, saying "Only a dark cocoon before I get my gorgeous wings / And fly away". The song features a piano played by James Taylor.
